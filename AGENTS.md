# Robot Game - Project Documentation

## Overview

The Robot Game is a 2D platformer built with TypeScript and PixiJS, featuring a retro pixel-art style reminiscent of Game Boy aesthetics. The game implements a modular, entity-component-system (ECS) inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns between game logic, rendering, and input handling.
